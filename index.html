  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I've been working in the service industry for the past 9 years, first in Minneapolis, MN and then moving to Portland, OR. I've spent most of my life on computers and early on having a passion for graphic design. While I didn't pursue a career in graphic design, it did develop into a hobby that became more photography focused. With my love of computers I had started to build my own machines, but I still felt like a fundamental knowledge of what all the hardware was actually running was lacking. Which brought me to <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus,</a> a coding bootcamp to help me learn the knowledge that I feel necessary to pursure a career in tech.</p>
