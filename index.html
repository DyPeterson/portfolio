  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I was raised in a small town in Minnesota and decided I needed to see more of the world. My first move being to Minneapolis, MN and then moving to Portland, OR. I've spent most of my life on computers and early on having a passion for graphic design. While I didn't pursue a career in graphic design, it did develop into a hobby that became more photography focused. With my love of computers I had started to build my own machines, but I still felt like a fundamental knowledge of what all the hardware was actually running was lacking. Which brought me to <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus,</a> a coding bootcamp to help me learn the knowledge that I feel necessary to pursure a career in tech.</p>
  <h3>My Background</h3>
  <p>I've been in the service industry for about 9 years at the time of writing this. While this has taught me a great deal of skills and introduce some great people in my life. It doesn't feel like the path I want to continue forever. So in March of 2022 I started a coding bootcamp called <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. To pivot to a new chapter of my life, that I feel will be more fulfilling and enriching to me personally.

  <h3>Interests, hobbies, and skills</h3>
  <p>In my free time I enjoy delving deep into records and exploring the vast world of music. I also enjoy cooking, and chasing after that perfect flavor while also showing restraint. Also previously mentioned i enjoy graphic design, i've taught myself a great deal of photoshop. Like cooking its another outlet to try to make the best image possible.</p>
